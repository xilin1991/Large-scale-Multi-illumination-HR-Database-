# Large-scale-Multi-illumination-HR-Database
## 1.Overview

BUAA-MIHR database is a database for remote heart rate (HR) estimation from face videos under multi-illumination situations. We recruited 15 healthy subjects (12 male, 3 female, 18 to 30 years old) in this experiment and a total number of 165 video sequences were recorded under various illuminations. The experiments were conducted in a darkroom in order to isolate from ambient light.

## 2.Apparatus and Experimental Environment

Logitech HD pro webcam C930E color camera was used to record videos of 640 Ã— 480 pixels, 8 bit depth, 30 fps, 60s, uncompressed bitmap format. PPG signal was measured using CONTEC CMS50E.

The video is captured in a darkroom, which is covered witha blackout cloth. A split type illuminometer is used as the instrument for measuring light intensity and brightness in the darkroom. We varied illuminance in the range: {$$10^0, 10^{0.2}, 10^{0.4}, 10^{0.6}, 10^{0.8}, 10^{1.0}, 10^{1.2}, 10^{1.4}, 10^{1.6}, 10^{1.8}, 10^{2.0}$$} lux (equivalent to {1.0, 1.6, 2.5, 4.0, 6.3, 10.0, 15.8, 25.1, 39.8, 63.1, 100.0} lux).
